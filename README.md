# MAZE MAKER

The purpose of this project is the craetion of a simple animation that generates a random maze 
using a MST algorithm.

## What is MST?

MST stands for *Minimum Spanning Tree*, a classic problem of graph theory. Given a graph **G( V , E )**
that is positive weighted and non-directional, find the subgraph **A( Va , Ea )** in **G** that fits the three
following rules:

    1 - A have all nodes of G, i.e Va == V 
    2 - A is a Tree, i.e have no cicles
    3 - The total weight of A is the smallest possible.

the picture bellow gives a good example:

The two algorithms described bellow are the most known for solving the MST problem.
